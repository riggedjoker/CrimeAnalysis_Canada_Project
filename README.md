<h3>Objective</h3>
<p> This project's objective is to analyze crime rate trends and the severity of crimes across Canada, focusing on identifying patterns across different provinces and territories.

Our analysis will highlight regional differences in crime severity, helping to provide insights into trends, potential causes, and their implications for law enforcement and policymaking.  </p>
